    <h4>ASWWU Outdoors provides students with a variety of outdoor recreational trips, educational courses, and rental gear for outdoor adventures. We believe that being outside is one of the best ways to relieve stress, make friends, and grow closer to God. We have trips that cater to both first-timers and seasoned veterans, but every trip is focused on safety and fun. We hope to see you out there!</h4>
