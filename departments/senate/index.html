      Every week, 26 senators meet to discuss and act on ways that we can improve our Universityâ€™s Campuses. Much like the like the United States, we follow Roberts Rules of Order, and vote and debate on many issues surrounding ASWWU and our campus. We meet on Thursday nights at 9 PM in WEC 217. If you are interested in learning more about how Senate works, feel free to join us. Over the last two years, senate has funded many campus improvement projects including the installation of water bottle fillers, bike racks, Swimsuit dryers, reflective vests, improved campus lighting insecurity, and of course, ASWWU bikes.

      For those of you who want to get technical, Senate is the legislative branch of ASWWU. Senate approves the budget every year and oversees all changes to the governing documents. Senators are elected the third week of fall quarter every year, and at the beginning of each quarter any student may challenge a Senate position. To apply to become a Senator, print and fill out this Declaration of Candidacy form.

      If you have any ideas for ways our campus can be improved, contact your district Senator, or email
