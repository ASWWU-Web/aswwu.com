    <h5>At the completion of any project, wether passed or failed by senate, each senator is required to submit a report detailing their work and certifying that improvements have been implemented. This ensures transparency to the student body, and allows future Senators to understand the research and reasoning behind each bill and to be able to easily pick up where others left off.</h5>
