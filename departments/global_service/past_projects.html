    <h5>ASWWUâ€™s Global Service department was created for the sole purpose of providing WWU students with avenues to make a positive impact on communities around our globe. We have a rich history of working to raise money through events, sales and donations for global, humanitarian efforts. Two years ago we raised money to build an orphanage in Uganda where we currently have student missionaries and last year we raised enough money to build a school in Indonesia.</h5>
