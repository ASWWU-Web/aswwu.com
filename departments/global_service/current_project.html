    <h5>For this yearâ€™s Global Service project we are focusing on providing education to Congolese refugees living in Rwanda through individual sponsorships of refugees. Some of you may know that Rwanda went through genocide only 20 years ago, where they estimate 1 million people died in about 100 days. Well, in the past decade the country has rebuilt itself, but in neighboring countries like the Congo, the killing continues. Therefore thousands and thousands of refugees flee to Rwanda in search of safety and peace.</h5>

    <h5>This summer some of us from ASWWU were able to visit Rwanda. Rwanda is a beautiful country located in the heart of Africa and it is known as the land of a thousand hills. Our purpose there was to get footage and hear stories that we would be able to share with you. While we were there we saw what life was like in the refugee camps. Among many hardships of living in poverty such as hunger, small living spaces and eight mile walks to school, refugee teenagers are often unable to finish their high school education. We decided to partnership with ADRA Rwanda, Impact Hope and UNHCR to change this. What they are doing and what we will be doing is sponsoring refugee kids to finish high school. </h5>
    <br>
    <h5>While there, we visited some of the refugee students who were currently attending high school and we asked them to tell us their story. We heard stories of hardship but also of renewed hope and big dreams through the opportunity they received to finish school. This is why we are calling our project Hope in the Hills.</h5>
