    <h5>The ASWWU Global Service Project for the 2015-2016 school year is called One of These. The goal of this project is to raise the funds necessary to open and operate Bangka Island Adventist School, a National Plus school to be started on Bangka Island, in the Bangka-Belitung province of Indonesia.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>By opening this school, ASWWU Global Service will provide key support in enabling the local Adventist Mission to meet the need for education on Bangka Island. With a National Plus status, the Bangka Island Adventist School will be certified to teach both the standard, national curriculum as well as additional classes - such as English - that will open up many more opportunities for local students, and provide the experience of a Christ-centered education. Our belief in the importance of this project is reflected in its name which is pulled from Mark 9:36-37: One of These. We are doing this in His name with the faith that Jesus has plans for each of these children and is calling on us to look out for them and their needs. In doing so, we recognize the need for Godâ€™s guidance in our own lives as he grows and shapes us through the act of service.</h5>
