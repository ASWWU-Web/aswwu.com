    This year ASWWU Global Service is partnering with non-profit Beehive International to build a classroom/wood building to start their trade school in Haiti - a project we call <i>On This Rock</i>. Our goal for the 2017-2018 year is to raise $60,000.
    <br />
    Haiti was once considered the Pearl of the Caribbean, but its history has been plagued with suffering which has caused it to remain the least developed country in the Americas. There are many needs in Haiti, but there is especially a need for a balanced education. An education that encompasses the mental as well as the physical and spiritual. An education that promotes self-sustainability.
    <br />
    The Beehive international has started a project, called <i>The Perl</i>, which aims to build a trade school in Haiti where industrial arts will be taught. Beehive international’s philosophy is unique in Haiti because they believe the best way to help somebody is to empower them to help themselves.
    <br />
    In Psalm 118:22 it says: “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.” We believe God has big plans for this small school and so this year we are claiming this promise for our project in Haiti.
    <br />
    Our mission is to create a foundation for sustainable community and career development in Haiti.
